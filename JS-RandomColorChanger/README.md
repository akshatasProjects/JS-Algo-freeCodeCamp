# Step 1

CamperBot is trying to build out a random background color changer. But they keep running into issues and need your help to debug the code.

- CamperBot has already added the HTML and CSS for the project. But they are confused as to why none of the styles and content is showing up on the page.

- When they open up the console they see this message:

      SyntaxError: unknown: Unexpected token, expected "," (5:2)

# Step 2

Now, CamperBot is trying to create a function that will return a random index from the darkColorsArr. But they have run into the following error message:

      Uncaught ReferenceError: math is not defined

# Step 3

Now that the ReferenceError is resolved, the console is displaying the correct results for a random number between 0 and 9. But CamperBot was not expecting to see decimal numbers like these:

- Update the console statement to print a whole number between 0 and 9.

- Remember that you worked with a method in the Role Playing Game that rounds a number down to the nearest whole number.

# Step 4

CamperBot is finished with building out the getRandomIndex function and it is working as expected.

- But now they are running into this issue when trying to create a reference to the body element in the DOM:

      Uncaught TypeError: document.queryselector is not a function

- A TypeError means that the code is trying to perform an operation on a value that is not of the expected type.

- Fix the TypeError by updating the document.queryselector method to the correct method name that selects an element from the DOM

# Step 5

CamperBot has created a new variable called bgHexCodeSpanElement to store the reference to the span element with the id of bg-hex-code. However, when they try to log that variable to the console, they get null.

# Step 6

CamperBot has now created a function called changeBackgroundColor that changes the background color of the page to a random color from the darkColorsArr array. The function also displays the hex code for that new color.

# Step 8

CamperBot has finished building out their random background color changer. However, when they click the button, the background color does not change.
